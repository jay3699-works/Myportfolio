                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a problem-solver at heart, blending engineering precision, business strategy, and AI-driven insights to create meaningful impact. With a background in Mechanical Engineering from NIT Trichy, I have developed a strong analytical mindset that allows me to break down complex challenges—whether in technology, business operations, or market strategy—into actionable solutions.</p>
                <p>My entrepreneurial journey began in college, where I launched a food takeaway business, scaling operations and generating profits that covered my semester’s hostel fees. This experience fueled my passion for building scalable solutions, a mindset I now apply to business consulting, AI-driven analytics, and strategic decision-making.</p>
                <p>I am deeply fascinated by the power of AI in transforming industries. From optimizing business processes with SQL and AI-powered Excel models to leveraging predictive analytics in consulting simulations, I constantly explore ways to integrate AI into problem-solving. My experience in data analysis, process mapping, and market research has strengthened my ability to translate insights into impactful decisions.</p>
                <p>Beyond analytics, I thrive in leadership roles, having managed public relations for national events and driven marketing campaigns that increased participation by 25%. I enjoy collaborating with teams, managing stakeholders, and executing strategies that deliver results.</p>
                <p>At my core, I believe in adaptability, structured problem-solving, and the limitless potential of AI to drive innovation. Whether it's optimizing business operations, crafting data-driven strategies, or building AI-powered solutions, I am passionate about turning ideas into scalable impact.</p>
